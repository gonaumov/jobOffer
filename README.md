# A tiny java file reader and scrapper

This is a very small Java workout of mine that I did just for fun.

## What this program do? 
It reads the file with candidates (inputData.txt), parses them with regular expression and decides which candidates need 
to be hired.

## What is the result? 
The program will output:
```
We will offer a job for the following candidates:
John
Mary
Alexander
```
